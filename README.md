# AI-Assistant

A practical project exploring Generative AI and Agentic AI concepts through the development of a modular, intelligent assistant.

## Overview

**AI-Assistant** is a hands-on project created to explore how Agentic AI works in practice. The goal is to build a simple AI assistant that can autonomously plan and complete tasks using Generative AI models. This project serves as a learning environment to experiment with ideas such as tool use, memory, and autonomous reasoning.

## Key Objectives

- Explore and understand the capabilities of open-source models and local inference.
- Understand and implement basic principles of **Agentic AI**
- Build a functional assistant powered by a **Generative AI model**
- Learn how to combine LLMs with planning and decision-making
- Set the foundation for more complex, multi-agent systems
